Project Description: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) for Emotion Detection

This project involves analyzing a dataset containing emotional content to gain insights into the distribution and characteristics of emotions. The dataset seems to include text data, timestamps, tokenized words, and columns representing various emotions such as disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.

Key Steps:

Loading the Dataset: The dataset, likely a CSV file, is loaded into a pandas DataFrame for analysis.

Basic Data Exploration:Displaying the first few rows of the dataset.

Summarizing the structure and characteristics of the dataset (data types, missing values).
Generating basic statistics (mean, standard deviation, min, max, etc.) for numeric fields.

Emotion Analysis:

The dataset contains columns representing different emotions, and the analysis aims to identify the dominant emotion for each row.
The descriptive statistics explore the distribution of various emotions like disgust, fear, happiness, sadness, surprise, and neutrality.
The analysis includes identifying the most common or dominant emotion across the dataset.
